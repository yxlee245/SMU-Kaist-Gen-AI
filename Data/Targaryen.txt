House Targaryen of Dragonstone is an exiled Great House of Westeros and the former royal house of the Seven Kingdoms. House Targaryen conquered and unified the realm before it was deposed during Robert's Rebellion, where House Baratheon replaced it as the new royal house. The two surviving Targaryens, Viserys and Daenerys, fled into exile to the Free Cities of Essos across the Narrow Sea.

House Lannister replaced House Baratheon as the royal house in the aftermath of the War of the Five Kings, but they were defeated in the Last War. After Daenerys burnt King's Landing, she was assassinated by her nephew Jon Snow to prevent further destruction. Jon is the last known Targaryen, but his identity as the son of Rhaegar Targaryen is kept a secret, and he was exiled to the Night's Watch for the assassination of Daenerys, effectively ending House Targaryen. However, the bloodline of House Targaryen still exists in various houses, such as House Baratheon, House Velaryon, and House Martell.

House Targaryen's sigil is a three-headed red dragon on a black background, and their house words are "Fire and Blood." The head of House Targaryen is referred to as "the dragon."
